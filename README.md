# F1-Predictor
A machine learning model to predict the results of an F1 race given its qualifying results and championship standings. To predict a race, make appropriate changes to 'predict-race.csv' and run 'F1-Predict-Race.py'. This will provide predictions based on two models for all 20 drivers. 

Training data was collected using the Ergast Developer API and the official F1 website.
